{"message":"dereference of raw pointer is unsafe and requires unsafe function or block","code":{"code":"E0133","explanation":"Unsafe code was used outside of an unsafe block.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0133\nunsafe fn f() { return; } // This is the unsafe code\n\nfn main() {\n    f(); // error: call to unsafe function requires unsafe function or block\n}\n```\n\nUsing unsafe functionality is potentially dangerous and disallowed by safety\nchecks. Examples:\n\n* Dereferencing raw pointers\n* Calling functions via FFI\n* Calling functions marked unsafe\n\nThese safety checks can be relaxed for a section of the code by wrapping the\nunsafe instructions with an `unsafe` block. For instance:\n\n```\nunsafe fn f() { return; }\n\nfn main() {\n    unsafe { f(); } // ok!\n}\n```\n\nSee the [unsafe section][unsafe-section] of the Book for more details.\n\n#### Unsafe code in functions\n\nUnsafe code is currently accepted in unsafe functions, but that is being phased\nout in favor of requiring unsafe blocks here too.\n\n```\nunsafe fn f() { return; }\n\nunsafe fn g() {\n    f(); // Is accepted, but no longer recommended\n    unsafe { f(); } // Recommended way to write this\n}\n```\n\nLinting against this is controlled via the `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` lint, which\nis `allow` by default but will be upgraded to `warn` in a future edition.\n\n[unsafe-section]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":2606,"byte_end":2615,"line_start":96,"line_end":96,"column_start":22,"column_end":31,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        print!(\"{}\", (*l).ival);","highlight_start":22,"highlight_end":31}],"label":"dereference of raw pointer","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":{"span":{"file_name":"/home/c00834010/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/std/src/macros.rs","byte_start":2440,"byte_end":2470,"line_start":81,"line_end":81,"column_start":28,"column_end":58,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        $crate::io::_print($crate::format_args!($($arg)*));","highlight_start":28,"highlight_end":58}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":{"span":{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":2593,"byte_end":2616,"line_start":96,"line_end":96,"column_start":9,"column_end":32,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        print!(\"{}\", (*l).ival);","highlight_start":9,"highlight_end":32}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},"macro_decl_name":"print!","def_site_span":{"file_name":"/home/c00834010/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/std/src/macros.rs","byte_start":2368,"byte_end":2386,"line_start":79,"line_end":79,"column_start":1,"column_end":19,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"macro_rules! print {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":19}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}}},"macro_decl_name":"$crate::format_args!","def_site_span":{"file_name":"/home/c00834010/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/core/src/macros/mod.rs","byte_start":29975,"byte_end":29999,"line_start":876,"line_end":876,"column_start":5,"column_end":29,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    macro_rules! format_args {","highlight_start":5,"highlight_end":29}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}}}],"children":[{"message":"raw pointers may be null, dangling or unaligned; they can violate aliasing rules and cause data races: all of these are undefined behavior","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0133]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: dereference of raw pointer is unsafe and requires unsafe function or block\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0msrc/main.rs:96:22\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m96\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m        print!(\"{}\", (*l).ival);\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mdereference of raw pointer\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: raw pointers may be null, dangling or unaligned; they can violate aliasing rules and cause data races: all of these are undefined behavior\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args` which comes from the expansion of the macro `print` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\u001b[0m\n\n"}
